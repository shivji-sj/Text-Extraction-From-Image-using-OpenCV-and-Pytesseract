This is a basic extraction system in which I experiment with mulitple image and enhance the system. 


Benefits : 

1) It helps to extract text from document images.
2) This system enhance the productive time of extracting text from an image.
3) √ùou don't need to copy paste. You can convert text into a file for furthur use.


# Applications:

1) Document Scanner
2) Number Plate Detection
3) Automatic insurance documents key information extraction.



How to use it ?

Steps : 1
    a) Create a instance of "Text_Extraction()"
Steps : 2 Choose according your needs. There are three things that you will use.
      a) Show your passed image : use instance of step 1 and call the "show_image()" function and put your image for extracrting text "path of your image/ image file"
      b) In this function you will get text from the images use instance of step 1 and call the "text_from_images()" fucntion and put your image for extracrting text "path of your image/ image file"
      Note : It is useful only extracted text from image. If you want to a file use "text_to_file()" funtion with "image path".
      c) "text_to_file", This function will help you to convert a image text into a file for you future use.
      
      
example : 1  (Extract Text from Image)

te = Text_Extraction()
te.text_from_image("path of your image")

example : 2  (Convert Extracted Text into file)

te = Text_Extraction()
te.text_to_file("path of your image")

example : 3  (Show your Passed Image)

te = Text_Extraction()
te.show_image("path of your image")




Assumptions: 

There are some assumptions which affected the Text Extraction System ans also it will give poor result.


1) Pixels of Image : Low pixel size image will not provide a good result.
2) Angle of Image : How much your image is tilted/angled.
3) Noise in the Image : Noise will affected hardly to find the desecent result.
